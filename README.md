### Install

From command line:

`yunohost app install seafile`

### Upgrade

By default a backup is made before the upgrade. To avoid this you have theses following possibilites:
- Pass the `NO_BACKUP_UPGRADE` env variable with `1` at each upgrade. By example `NO_BACKUP_UPGRADE=1 yunohost app upgrade synapse`.
- Set the settings `disable_backup_before_upgrade` to `1`. You can set this with this command:

`yunohost app setting synapse disable_backup_before_upgrade -v 1`

After this settings will be applied for **all** next upgrade.

From command line:

`yunohost app upgrade seafile`

### Backup

This app use now the core-only feature of the backup. To keep the integrity of the data and to have a better guarantee of the restoration is recommended to proceed like this:

- Stop seafile service with theses following command:

`systemctl stop seafile.service seahub.service`

- Launch the backup of seafile with this following command:

`yunohost backup create --app seafile`

- Do a backup of your data with your specific strategy (could be with rsync, borg backup or just cp). The data is stored in `/home/yunohost.app/seafile-data`.
- Restart the seafile service with theses command:

`systemctl start seafile.service seahub.service`

### Remove

Due of the backup core only feature the data directory in `/home/yunohost.app/seafile-data` **is not removed**. It need to be removed manually to purge app user data.

### Change URL

Since now it's possible to change domain or the url of seafile.

To do this run : `yunohost app change-url seafile -d new_domain.tld -p PATH new_path`
